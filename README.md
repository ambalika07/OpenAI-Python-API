# OpenAI-Python-API

This project explores the vast capabilities of the OpenAI API, demonstrating its power in generating text, creating images, producing text vector embeddings, and implementing advanced API methods. Through a series of diverse applications, we showcase the potential of AI integration in Python for various real-world scenarios.

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI account
- API key (configured securely)
- Python environment

Key Projects:
1. Natural Language to SQL Converter - Transforms human language queries into SQL statements, bridging the gap between natural language and database interactions.
2. Automatic Exam Creator - Leverages OpenAI's Completion API to generate quizzes and solution guides for educators based on a given topic.
3. AI-Powered Recipe and Image Generator - Creates recipes and corresponding food images from a list of ingredients using OpenAI and DALL-E.
4. Automated Blog Post Publisher - Generates and publishes blog posts instantly, complete with images, using GitHub Pages for automatic deployment.
5. Reddit Sentiment Analyzer - Analyzes sentiment in subreddit posts about stocks and companies, providing insights into public opinion.
6. Automatic Code Documenter - Utilizes OpenAI's Codex models to generate Python docstrings, enhancing code readability and documentation.
7. Fine-Tuned StackOverflow ChatBot - Custom-trained model to answer Python-related questions, mimicking a StackOverflow-style interaction.
8. Multilingual News Translator and Summarizer - Automatically reads, translates, and summarizes news articles from foreign sources.
